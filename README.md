# Be Safe

## About

**Be Safe** is a mobile application designed to provide women with a sense of security when walking alone or feeling unsafe. Through a real-time map interface, users can see other women nearby, connect with them, and access features that enhance their safety.

## Features

- **Real-Time Map Support** – View other women near your location for added safety and companionship.
- **Tap to Connect** – Click on nearby women’s icons for:
  - Support chat
  - Quick emergency calls
  - Live location sharing
  - Video calls for enhanced safety
- **Emergency Numbers Section** – Quick access to local emergency contacts.
- **Fake Call (Upcoming Feature)** – Simulates a conversation with AI-generated speech suggestions to deter potential threats by making it seem like someone is aware of your location.

## Tech Stack

- **Built with Expo** – Leveraging the power of React Native for seamless cross-platform performance.
